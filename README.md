# Graduate-Program-Application-GAPP

- In this project I am going to develop a web-based system we call Graduate Program Applications, or GAPP, which will host all the application materials. Specifically:

1. Students will use CSUMentor to submit a university application and use GAPP to submit a department application - we assume that a department application will be required by all departments.
2. University admission staff will upload scanned transcripts to GAPP.
3. Department staff will upload additional application materials (e.g. personal statement, recommendation letters) to GAPP.
4. Department admission committee will use GAPP to review the applications.
